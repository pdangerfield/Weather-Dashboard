# Weather Dashboard


## Description

This webpage is meant to allow you search a name of a city and have the current weather and a 5 day forecast returned to you. It will also store your search history at the bottom of the page allowing you to use them as quick buttons in the future to get the weather that way.

## Installation

There is no real installation required but you can access the page by going to https://pdangerfield.github.io/Weather-Dashboard/

## Usage

When you load the page (https://pdangerfield.github.io/Weather-Dashboard/) you will be given an area that you can enter the name of a city and then click search. Upon clicking search it will get the current weather for that city as well as a 5 day forecast with weather icons, temp, wind, and humidity. Towards the bottom of the page your search history will be stored so that you can click on them in the future without needing to type in the city name again.
